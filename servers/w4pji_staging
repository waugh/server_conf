    # If you have IPv6, you'll likely want to have two separate listeners.
    # One on IPv4 only (the default), and another on IPv6 only instead
    # of a single dual-stack listener.  A dual-stack listener will make
    # for ugly IPv4 addresses in $remote_addr (e.g ":ffff:10.0.0.1"
    # instead of just "10.0.0.1") and potentially trigger bugs in
    # some software.
