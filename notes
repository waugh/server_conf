Directory  names  c0 and c1 stand for case zero and case one, where case zero is
"before" and case one is "after" the changes are made to the  system  configura-
tion.  These directories mirror the root directory with regard to changed files.
So for example, if I have to change /etc/hosts, I put the version of  /etc/hosts
that came with the system in c0/etc/hosts, and my version in c1/etc/hosts.  If I
have  to change /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, I put the version that came with nginx in
c0/etc/nginx/nginx.conf and I put my modified version in c1/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
.

Postfix is now set up with a default configuration.  If you need to make 
changes, edit
/etc/postfix/main.cf (and others) as needed.  To view Postfix configuration
values, see postconf(1).

After modifying main.cf, be sure to run '/etc/init.d/postfix reload'.
